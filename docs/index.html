                        <p>It was a very special night for a local band as their lead vocalist created a new scale while singing. Listeners were treated to the performance of a lifetime last Friday night. Imperfect hosts sources advise that the lead vocalist was constantly creating new "harmonic tones" throughout the performance.</p>
                        <p>Although this was not a first in music, singer is credited with a consistent special use of new scales; these included notes slightly above or below chord roots. According to Asian born guitarist "Wy Tune", the vocalist has had the special talent since joining early last year.</p>
                        <p>The club owner where the event occurred suggested that it was hard to observe the special "harmonic tones" as the instruments were very loud; he was confident though that the new scales were indeed created.</p>
